/**
 * The second-order Greeks a vol book actually hedges with — analytic
 * Black-Scholes forms, the risk-side complement to
 * {@link BlackScholes#greeks}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Vanna</b> {@code ∂²V/∂S∂σ} — how delta drifts when vol moves
 *       (equivalently, how vega drifts when spot moves). THE skew-hedging
 *       Greek: a delta-hedged book with vanna is not hedged through a
 *       spot-vol move, which is how equity markets actually move
 *       (down-spot, up-vol);</li>
 *   <li><b>Volga</b> {@code ∂²V/∂σ²} (vomma) — vega convexity: a
 *       vega-hedged book with volga re-exposes itself as soon as vol
 *       moves. Vanna and volga are the two Greeks the
 *       {@link VannaVolga} pricing method charges the smile for;</li>
 *   <li><b>Cross-gamma</b> — for a TWO-asset position, the P&amp;L term
 *       {@code ∂²V/∂S₁∂S₂} that plain per-asset gammas miss; supplied
 *       here for the exchange-option/basket case under a correlation
 *       (the general multi-asset case needs the full Hessian of your
 *       specific payoff).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Same conventions as {@code BlackScholes}: {@code carry} is the
 * continuous YIELD q (dividend yield; the foreign rate for FX), so the
 * spot prefix is {@code e^{−qT}} and the drift is {@code r − q} —
 * exactly the parameters you already pass to
 * {@code BlackScholes.delta/vega}, and the tests pin these formulas as
 * finite differences of those. Vol per √year, all static and
 * allocation-free. Vanna/volga are identical for calls and puts
 * (put-call parity kills the sign difference in the second order).</p>
