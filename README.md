**quantfinlib** is a production-ready quantitative finance platform for the JVM that unifies
risk management, portfolio optimization, machine learning, technical analysis, strategy
development, market screening, Monte Carlo simulation, reporting, and algorithmic research
in a single Java library — for multi-asset workflows (FX, equities, commodities, and more).

Built for quantitative researchers, algorithmic traders, developers, fintech teams, and
financial professionals: focus on building winning strategies while the platform handles
everything from backtesting to reporting.

- **Ultra low latency / HFT-grade hot path** — a zero-allocation, lock-free tick
  pipeline (Disruptor-style primitive ring buffer, dense int symbol ids, O(1) streaming
  indicators) measured at **~200 ns median publish-to-strategy latency** and
  **9-12M ticks/sec sustained** with a live strategy attached. See
  [Ultra-Low-Latency / HFT Path](#ultra-low-latency--hft-path).
- **Production-ready** — deterministic seeded algorithms, NaN-safe indicator warm-ups,
  gap-aware stop-loss/take-profit fills, and a full JUnit 5 test suite.
- **Modular architecture, clean APIs** — each capability lives in its own package with
  small, composable interfaces (`RiskMetric`, `TradingStrategy`, `Rule`, `ScreenFilter`,
  `ReportExporter`) for extension.

## Requirements

- JDK 24+
- Maven 3.9+

```bash
mvn test                                                    # build + full test suite
java -cp target/classes com.quantfinlib.examples.QuickStartDemo # end-to-end tour
mvn package && java -jar target/quant-finance-library-*.jar help   # runnable CLI jar
```

**See it trade in five minutes** (live Binance data → streaming strategy → paper
venue → browser dashboard, no keys or accounts needed):

```bash
mvn package -DskipTests
java -cp target/classes com.quantfinlib.examples.LiveTradingDemo
# → open http://localhost:8080
```

**New to finance or low-latency engineering?** Start with
[docs/LEARN.md](docs/LEARN.md) — a from-zero tutorial that teaches every
concept in this library in plain language (order books, market making,
execution algos, last look, options, garbage collection, ring buffers, the
memory model, honest benchmarking…), each tied to the class that implements
it, with a guided reading path and exercises.

**Learn by task, not by API**: [docs/COOKBOOK.md](docs/COOKBOOK.md) — twelve complete
recipes under 20 lines each, from "backtest your CSV" through survivorship-honest
factor research and nanosecond market making to portfolio-level execution and
overnight state persistence.

**Getting the library**: tagged releases publish runnable/sources/javadoc jars
automatically (GitHub Actions → Releases); JitPack works today
(`com.github.AshJha0:Quant-Finance-Library:v1.9.0`); Maven Central publishing is
wired and one account-setup away — see [docs/PUBLISHING.md](docs/PUBLISHING.md).
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release history.

## The 11 Capabilities

### 1. Advanced Risk Analysis — `com.quantfinlib.risk`
Portfolio and asset-level risk with a flexible analytics engine: volatility, exposure,
correlation, multi-asset support, and risk decomposition (fractional contribution of each
asset to portfolio variance).

```java
PortfolioRiskAnalyzer analyzer = new PortfolioRiskAnalyzer(symbols, assetReturns, weights);
PortfolioRiskAnalyzer.RiskReport risk = analyzer.analyze(0.95, 252);
risk.annualizedVolatility(); risk.valueAtRisk(); risk.riskContributions(); risk.correlationMatrix();
```

### 2. Real-Time Market Data Processing — `com.quantfinlib.marketdata`
Lock-free ring buffer ingestion, per-symbol subscriptions, a latest-price cache,
continuous portfolio mark-to-market, and an in-memory historical store.

```java
try (MarketDataProcessor mdp = new MarketDataProcessor()) {
    mdp.monitor(portfolio);                       // continuous portfolio monitoring
    mdp.subscribe("EURUSD", e -> onTick(e));
    mdp.start();
    mdp.publish(new MarketDataEvent("EURUSD", 1.0850, 1_000_000, System.nanoTime()));
}
```

### 3. Machine Learning Risk Forecasting — `com.quantfinlib.ml`
Gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost-style additive boosting, pure Java) over engineered
volatility/momentum features predict forward realized volatility and produce a 0–100
risk score.

```java
VolatilityForecaster f = VolatilityForecaster.weekly().fit(returns);
double nextWeekVol = f.forecast(returns);
double score = f.riskScore(returns);              // 0-100 intelligent risk score
```

### 4. Portfolio Optimization Engine — `com.quantfinlib.optimization`
Maximum Sharpe, minimum volatility, efficient frontier, and rebalancing deltas
(long-only, fully invested; deterministic stochastic search + refinement, no solver
dependency).

```java
PortfolioOptimizer opt = new PortfolioOptimizer(expectedReturns, covariance);
Allocation best = opt.maxSharpe(0.02);
Allocation safest = opt.minVolatility();
List<Allocation> frontier = opt.efficientFrontier(20);
```

### 5. Custom Risk Metrics Framework — `com.quantfinlib.risk`
Built-in VaR / CVaR / Expected Shortfall / volatility / downside deviation plus
user-defined metrics through a one-method interface.

```java
Map<String, Double> all = RiskMetricRegistry.withDefaults()
        .register("WorstDay", r -> -Arrays.stream(r).min().orElse(0))
        .calculateAll(portfolioReturns);
```

### 6. Advanced Strategy Backtesting Engine — `com.quantfinlib.backtest`
Built-in SMA / EMA / RSI / MACD / Bollinger / MA-cross strategies; commission, slippage,
intrabar stop-loss/take-profit with gap-aware fills; full analytics: CAGR, annual return,
Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, profit factor, win rate, max drawdown, equity curve, trade history.

```java
BacktestResult r = Backtester.run(new SmaCrossStrategy(20, 50), series, BacktestConfig.defaults());
r.metrics().sharpeRatio(); r.equityCurve(); r.trades();
```

### 7. Professional Stock Screener — `com.quantfinlib.screener`
Technical filters (RSI, EMA/SMA, MACD, ADX, ATR, VWAP, SuperTrend, Bollinger, Ichimoku,
breakout, volume spike, gap, 52-week high/low) and fundamental filters (market cap, P/E,
P/B, EPS, ROE, dividend yield, debt/equity), plus a weighted ranking engine and CSV export.

```java
var ranked = new StockScreener(universe).screenAndRank(
        new RankingEngine()
                .addCriterion("ROE", 1.0, s -> s.fundamentals().roe())
                .addCriterion("P/E", -0.5, s -> s.fundamentals().peRatio()),
        FundamentalFilters.marketCapAbove(10e9),
        TechnicalFilters.rsiBelow(14, 70).and(TechnicalFilters.priceAboveSma(200)));
StockScreener.exportCsv(Path.of("screen.csv"), ranked);
```

### 8. Monte Carlo Portfolio Simulation — `com.quantfinlib.simulation`
10k–100k+ correlated multi-asset GBM scenarios in parallel: probability of profit/loss,
VaR, CVaR, confidence intervals, best/worst case, expected and median outcome.
Deterministic for a given seed.

```java
SimulationResult sim = new MonteCarloSimulator(42)
        .simulatePortfolio(1_000_000, weights, dailyMeans, dailyCov, 252, 100_000);
sim.probabilityOfProfit(); sim.valueAtRisk(0.95); sim.confidenceInterval(0.90);
```

### 9. Technical Indicator Engine — `com.quantfinlib.indicators`
RSI, SMA, EMA, WMA, VWAP, MACD, ATR, ADX, CCI, ROC, Momentum, OBV, CMF, SuperTrend,
Ichimoku Cloud, Stochastic RSI, Williams %R, Parabolic SAR, Bollinger Bands, Keltner
Channel, Donchian Channel. All return primitive arrays aligned to the input series
(NaN during warm-up) for seamless integration into quantitative workflows.

```java
double[] rsi = Indicators.rsi(series.closes(), 14);
Indicators.Macd macd = Indicators.macd(series.closes(), 12, 26, 9);
Indicators.SuperTrend st = Indicators.superTrend(series, 10, 3);
```

### 10. Professional Report Generator — `com.quantfinlib.report`
Portfolio summary, performance analytics, risk analysis, asset allocation, strategy
performance, trade history, Monte Carlo results, and technical summaries — exported to
**PDF**, **Excel (.xlsx)**, **HTML**, or **CSV**, all written natively with zero
dependencies. Implement `ReportExporter` for custom formats.

```java
new ReportGenerator("Q3 Portfolio Review")
        .addPortfolioSummary(portfolio)
        .addStrategyPerformance(backtest)
        .addRiskAnalysis(risk)
        .addMonteCarlo(sim)
        .addTradeHistory(backtest.trades())
        .toPdf(Path.of("review.pdf"));    // or .toExcel / .toHtml / .toCsv
```

### 11. Strategy Builder DSL — `com.quantfinlib.dsl`
Fluent API: define entry rules, exit conditions, stop loss, take profit — then backtest,
evaluate, and iterate quickly. Rules compose with `and` / `or` / `not`.

```java
BacktestResult r = StrategyBuilder.named("EMA momentum")
        .enterWhen(Rules.crossAbove(fastEma, slowEma).and(Rules.aboveValue(adx, 20)))
        .exitWhen(Rules.crossBelow(fastEma, slowEma))
        .withStopLoss(0.03)
        .withTakeProfit(0.08)
        .build()
        .backtest(series, 100_000);
```

## Trading & Execution Stack

Beyond the 11 research capabilities, the library ships a full trading-side stack across
six areas:

### 1. Market Microstructure & Liquidity Analytics — `orderbook`, `microstructure`
- **`OrderBook`** — price-time-priority matching engine: placement, cancels, partial
  fills, trade callbacks, queue position (`qtyAhead`), and message counters for
  order-to-trade ratio.
- **`BookAnalytics`** — quoted spread (bps), size-weighted microprice, depth imbalance,
  depth-within-bps, and non-destructive **sweep simulation** (VWAP-to-fill + impact of a
  large marketable order).
- **`QueueModel`** — fill probability from queue position, and the fill-probability edge
  bought by a latency advantage.
- **`MarketImpactModel`** — square-root law plus Almgren-Chriss-style temporary/permanent
  decomposition and expected schedule cost.
- **`TransactionCostAnalyzer`** — implementation shortfall vs arrival mid, slippage vs
  interval VWAP (or synthetic forward), effective spread per fill.
- **`AlmgrenChriss`** — optimal execution trajectories (closed-form): minimize
  expected cost + λ·variance; risk aversion front-loads the schedule, λ→0 recovers
  TWAP, and the efficient frontier maps the urgency trade-off.

### 2. Pricing & Fair Value Construction — `pricing`
- **`FairValueEngine`** — microprice + mid-drift estimation → **latency-adjusted fair
  price** ("true mid" projected to when your order actually arrives).
- **`TriangularArbitrage`** — executable (bid/ask-based) round-trip edge across three FX
  pairs.
- **`ForwardCurve`** — implied forward curve construction with interpolation, implied
  rate differentials, and covered-interest-parity mispricing checks.

### 3. Surveillance / Credit / Limits Risk Models — `risk`
- **`CounterpartyExposureTracker`** — netted current exposure + tenor-bucketed potential
  future exposure (BIS CEM-style add-ons).
- **`PreTradeLimitChecker`** — synchronous order gate: size, notional, position, price
  collar, restricted symbols, counterparty credit headroom.
- **`SettlementRiskAnalyzer`** — Herstatt exposure per counterparty and peak intraday
  settlement exposure.
- **`ConcentrationRisk`** — HHI, effective positions, top-N share, single-name limit
  breaches.

### 4. Statistical & ML Applications — `ml`
- **`MarketImpactPredictor`** — gradient-boosted impact prediction + calibrated
  book-sweep probability.
- **`IntradayLiquidityForecaster`** — seasonal volume profiles, session peaks
  (Tokyo/London/NY), VWAP-ready weight curves.
- **`AnomalyDetector`** — quote-stuffing detection (message-rate z-score × order-to-trade
  ratio) and price-spike surveillance.

### 5. Execution Strategy Support — `execution`
- **`TwapScheduler` / `VwapScheduler`** — schedule design with anti-gaming randomization
  and exact largest-remainder quantity allocation.
- **`MidPegTracker`** — mid-rate pegging with offset, limit cap, and reprice-threshold
  logic.
- **`SmartOrderRouter`** — fee-adjusted multi-venue splitting with displayed-size limits
  and dark-first routing.
- **`IcebergOrder`** — display/reload state machine with randomized tranche sizes.
- **`DarkPoolSimulator`** — midpoint-cross venue with minimum-execution-quantity
  constraints.
- **`VenueBenchmark`** — fill rate, latency-to-fill, effective spread, and post-trade
  markout per venue, ranked.

### 6. Benchmark & Regulatory Metrics — `regulatory`
- **`FixAnalyzer`** — WM/Reuters-style fix calculation (median of window samples) and
  "banging the close" screening (participation × aligned run-up × reversion).
- **`BestExecutionAnalyzer`** — MiFID II-style report: slippage, latency-to-fill,
  price-improvement rate, per-venue breakdown.
- **`MarketQualityMetrics`** — quoted/effective/realized spread, price impact,
  order-to-trade ratio.

```java
// Route 900 across venues, benchmark the result, and TCA the fills:
var plan = SmartOrderRouter.route(Side.BUY, 900, venueQuotes, /*preferDark*/ true);
var tca  = TransactionCostAnalyzer.analyze(fills, arrivalMid, marketVwap, midsAtFill);
var sweep = BookAnalytics.sweep(orderBook, Side.BUY, 500_000);   // what would it cost?
```

### Execution-aware backtesting — `backtest`

The classic `Backtester` assumes instant fills at the close. `ExecutionAwareBacktester`
instead turns every strategy signal into a **parent order worked through an
`ExecutionModel`** — fills can span multiple bars, liquidity is finite, and execution
cost becomes a measured output instead of an assumption:

- **`InstantExecution`** — baseline (classic fill assumption, all-in pricing).
- **`SorExecution`** — a synthetic fragmented market per bar (spread + per-venue
  liquidity share of bar volume, fees, dark venues) routed by `SmartOrderRouter`;
  large parents take multiple bars to fill.
- **`IcebergExecution`** — wraps any model with the `IcebergOrder` display/reload
  state machine plus an optional participation cap, so entries and exits are worked
  patiently.

Every child fill is recorded per parent order, and TCA is one call:

```java
ExecutionAwareResult r = ExecutionAwareBacktester.run(
        new SmaCrossStrategy(20, 50), series, BacktestConfig.defaults(),
        new IcebergExecution(
                new SorExecution(List.of(
                        new SorExecution.VenueConfig("LIT_A", 1.0, 0.05, false),
                        new SorExecution.VenueConfig("LIT_B", 0.5, 0.05, false),
                        new SorExecution.VenueConfig("DARK_X", 0.2, 0.03, true)),
                        /*halfSpreadBps*/ 5, /*preferDark*/ true),
                /*displayQty*/ 1_000));

r.backtest().metrics();                    // performance net of realistic execution
ParentOrder entry = r.parentOrders().getFirst();
r.tca(entry).implementationShortfallBps(); // measured cost vs arrival mid
```

Stop-loss / take-profit exits are worked through the same model — a patient execution
style exits slowly, and that realism (plus the strategy-alpha-vs-execution-cost
trade-off) shows up directly in the equity curve.

## Research Validation & Portfolio Engine

- **Walk-forward analysis** (`backtest.validation`) — `ParameterGrid` +
  `GridSearchOptimizer` optimize a strategy on rolling train windows; each winner is
  evaluated on the unseen test window and out-of-sample equity is stitched into one
  curve (capital carries across folds). The **walk-forward efficiency ratio** (OOS/IS)
  exposes curve-fitting at a glance.
- **Deflated Sharpe** (`SharpeValidation`) — Bailey/López de Prado probabilistic Sharpe
  (track length, skew, kurtosis) and the deflated variant that haircuts for the number
  of parameter combinations tried.
- **VaR backtesting** (`risk.VarBacktest`) — Kupiec proportion-of-failures (two-sided),
  Christoffersen independence (exception clustering), and joint conditional coverage:
  the difference between producing VaR numbers and producing *validated* VaR numbers.
- **Portfolio backtesting** (`backtest.portfolio`) — multi-asset, long/short,
  weight-based `PortfolioBacktester` with rebalance cadence and commission on turnover;
  `PositionSizing` supplies Kelly / half-Kelly, fixed-fractional risk, inverse-vol
  weights, and vol-target leverage.
- **Paper trading** (`trading`) — `OrderGateway` abstraction + quote-driven
  `PaperTradingGateway`: market/limit orders, resting-order crosses, average-cost
  positions with realized P&L, commissions, and the `PreTradeLimitChecker` wired in as
  a pre-market risk gate — the research→production loop, closed.
- **Data I/O** (`data`) — `CsvBarLoader` (flexible headers/date formats, RFC-4180
  quoted fields, thousands separators, file-level epoch-seconds detection, round-trip
  save) and `HttpBarFetcher` (pure `java.net.http`) bring real historical data into
  every module; `SeriesAligner` (timestamp intersection or union + forward-fill)
  bridges ragged multi-asset files to the index-aligned `PortfolioBacktester`.
- **Tick capture & replay** (`data`) — `TickCapture` records every tick flowing through
  the `HftMarketDataBus` into the compact QFLT binary format (28 bytes/tick, inline
  symbol definitions); `TickFileReader` replays sessions deterministically — as fast as
  possible for backtesting, or paced at any speed multiple of recorded time for
  live-like feeds. Record a session once, run every experiment against identical real
  microstructure.
- **Live market data over WebSocket** (`feed`) — real ticks into the HFT bus with pure
  JDK (`java.net.http` WebSocket client): pluggable `FeedParser` per exchange
  (`BinanceTradeParser` ships as the reference — raw and combined streams), automatic
  reconnection with exponential backoff, optional subscribe message, and exchange
  event-time timestamps so recorded sessions replay with true market pacing. Tested
  end-to-end against an in-repo RFC 6455 loopback server (connect, trades → bus →
  capture, subscribe protocol, abrupt-disconnect reconnect) — CI never touches a real
  exchange.

```java
HftMarketDataBus bus = new HftMarketDataBus();
TickCapture capture = TickCapture.attach(bus, Path.of("session.qflt"));
bus.start();
try (WebSocketFeed feed = new WebSocketFeed(
        BinanceTradeParser.streamUri("BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT"),
        new BinanceTradeParser(), bus)) {
    feed.start();   // live ticks now flow into strategies AND the recorder
}
```

- **FIX 4.4 connectivity** (`fix`) — a zero-dependency FIX engine: validated
  wire-format codec (BodyLength/CheckSum framing, fragmentation-safe stream decoder),
  full session layer (Logon handshake, Heartbeats with TestRequest probing and
  staleness disconnect, sequence-gap detection, Logout handshake), and the trading
  flow — `sendNewOrderSingle` out, typed `ExecutionReport`s in. Both **initiator and
  acceptor** roles, so the same class connects to a broker or *is* the venue
  simulator. **Full gap recovery**: inbound gaps trigger a ResendRequest (out-of-order
  messages are dropped and redelivered exactly once); inbound ResendRequests are
  serviced from the session's message store — application messages replayed with
  PossDupFlag/OrigSendingTime, admin runs coalesced into SequenceReset-GapFill;
  PossDup duplicates are suppressed and a too-low seqnum without PossDup disconnects.
  **Persistent sessions**: pass a `FileSessionStore` to `initiate`/`accept` for
  sequence-number continuation across restarts — ResendRequests are then serviced
  from messages sent before the reconnect, as production counterparties expect.
  Also: **order cancel/replace** (35=F/G with typed callbacks and
  canceled/replaced ExecutionReports), **session Reject** (35=3 — malformed
  application messages are auto-rejected instead of killing the session), and
  **Username/Password** (553/554) on Logon via `Config.withCredentials`.

```java
FixSession session = FixSession.initiate("broker.example.com", 9876,
        new FixSession.Config("MYFIRM", "BROKER", 30),
        new FixSession.Listener() {
            @Override public void onExecutionReport(FixSession s, ExecutionReport r) {
                if (r.isFill()) { /* update positions */ }
            }
        });
session.sendNewOrderSingle("ord-1", "EURUSD", Side.BUY, 1_000_000, 1.0851,
        NewOrderSingle.TIF_DAY);
```

- **Tick-level backtesting** (`backtest.tick`) — event-driven `TickBacktester` replays
  QFLT files through a `TickStrategy` with microstructure-aware fills: market orders
  pay half the spread; passive limit orders fill fully only when a print trades
  *through* the price, and fills at the level are earned print-by-print against a
  simulated queue ahead (`defaultQueueAhead`) — the level below bar backtesting, where
  queue position decides whether your order actually trades. Orders can never fill
  against the print that triggered them.

```java
// Capture a live session...
try (TickCapture capture = TickCapture.attach(bus, Path.of("session.qflt"))) {
    bus.start();
    /* ... trading day ... */
}
// ...then backtest strategies at tick level against the exact same tape:
var result = TickBacktester.run(myTickStrategy, Path.of("session.qflt"),
        TickBacktester.Config.defaults().withDefaultQueueAhead(500));
result.fills();            // every child fill with venue "TICK_SIM"
result.metrics();          // metrics on the sampled equity curve
```

```java
var wf = WalkForwardAnalyzer.analyze(series,
        new ParameterGrid().add("fast", 5, 10, 20).add("slow", 40, 60, 100),
        p -> new SmaCrossStrategy(p.get("fast").intValue(), p.get("slow").intValue()),
        BacktestConfig.defaults(), 252, 63, PerformanceMetrics::sharpeRatio);
wf.efficiency();               // OOS/IS objective ratio: ~1 robust, ~0 overfit
wf.outOfSampleMetrics();       // honest, stitched out-of-sample performance
```

## Quant Models — `rates`, `volatility`, `pricing`, `hedging`

- **Fixed income** (`rates`) — `YieldCurve` (zero curve, discount factors, implied
  forwards, classic bootstrap from annual par swap rates) and `BondPricer`
  (price/yield, Macaulay/modified duration, convexity, DV01, curve pricing).
- **Volatility models** (`volatility`) — `EwmaVolatility` (RiskMetrics λ=0.94) and
  `Garch11` (Gaussian MLE with variance targeting; k-step forecasts mean-revert to the
  unconditional variance).
- **American options** (`pricing.BinomialTree`) — CRR tree with early-exercise premium;
  converges to Black-Scholes for European payoffs.
- **SABR** (`pricing.SabrModel`) — Hagan 2002 implied vol + deterministic (α, ρ, ν)
  calibration: parametric smiles on top of `VolSurface` pillars.
- **Cointegration** (`hedging.CointegrationTest`) — Engle-Granger two-step with ADF
  t-statistic and critical values: the statistical gate before any `PairsHedger` trade.
- **Options book risk** (`hedging.OptionsBook`) — aggregate Greeks across positions and
  the underlying hedge, full-revaluation spot×vol scenario grids, and
  delta-gamma-vega-theta P&L explain with an unexplained residual.
- **Market conventions** (`rates`) — `DayCount` (ACT/360, ACT/365, 30/360, ACT/ACT
  ISDA), `BusinessCalendar` (holidays, FOLLOWING / MODIFIED_FOLLOWING / PRECEDING
  rolls, T+n settlement, coupon schedules), and date-based `BondPricer` methods
  (dirty/clean price, accrued interest) usable against real term sheets.
- **Portfolio construction** (`optimization`) — `RiskParityOptimizer` (equal risk
  contribution), `BlackLitterman` (equilibrium returns + view blending), and
  `ConstrainedPortfolioOptimizer` (position caps/floors, turnover penalty).
- **Regime detection** (`ml.RegimeDetector`) — 2-state Gaussian Markov-switching model
  (Baum-Welch EM): smoothed high-vol probabilities, transition persistence, current
  regime — feeds vol targeting and liquidity forecasting.
- **Corporate actions** (`data.CorporateActions`) — CRSP-style back-adjustment for
  splits (price and volume) and cash dividends (price only), composing across actions —
  the difference between toy and usable equity backtests.

## Hedging Algorithms — `hedging`, `pricing`

Quantitative hedging across asset classes, built on a dependency-free
Black-Scholes-Merton engine:

- **`BlackScholes`** (`pricing`) — pricing + full Greeks (delta, gamma, vega, theta,
  rho) with continuous carry, so the same formulas cover equity dividends and FX
  (Garman-Kohlhagen); implied vol by bisection. Verified against textbook values.
- **`DeltaHedger`** — dynamic delta hedging simulator: sell an option, replicate along
  a price path with a rebalance band and transaction costs, and measure the replication
  error. Quantifies the desk trade-off: tighter bands → smaller hedge error, more costs.
- **`GreekHedger`** — delta-gamma and delta-gamma-vega neutralization (exact linear
  solve), plus a general N-greek / N-instrument solver with residual verification.
- **`MinimumVarianceHedge`** — optimal hedge ratio (cov/var), hedge effectiveness (ρ²),
  realized variance reduction, and futures contract sizing for beta adjustment
  (`N = (β_target - β) · V / (F · multiplier)`).
- **`FxHedger`** — currency exposure netting across a book, variance-minimizing FX
  hedge ratio for foreign assets, forward-carry cost of the hedge in bps, and hedge
  notional sizing.
- **`PairsHedger`** — statistical hedging: OLS hedge ratio, spread construction,
  z-score for entry/exit, and mean-reversion half-life from an AR(1) fit (∞ when the
  spread doesn't revert).
- **`HedgingSimulator`** — Monte Carlo delta hedging: runs `DeltaHedger` across
  thousands of GBM paths in parallel (deterministic per seed) and returns the full
  `HedgingErrorDistribution` — replication error, hedging VaR/CVaR, probability of
  loss, cost and rebalance statistics. Hedge vol and realized vol are separate inputs,
  so both discretization risk and vol mispricing are directly measurable.
- **`VolSurface`** (`pricing`) — implied vol surface from pillar quotes or market
  prices (via `impliedVol`): linear smile interpolation in strike with flat wings,
  and total-variance (σ²T) interpolation across expiries for a calendar-consistent
  term structure; surface-consistent pricing and skew helpers.

```java
// Delta-hedge a short call daily with 1bp costs and measure replication error:
var report = DeltaHedger.simulateShortOption(OptionType.CALL, 100, 0.5,
        0.05, 0, 0.20, pricePath, 1.0 / 252, DeltaHedger.Config.every(1));
report.finalPnl();          // hedging error vs the option payoff

// Neutralize a book's delta/gamma/vega with spot + two options:
double[] qty = GreekHedger.deltaGammaVegaHedge(1_200, -80, 250, opt1, opt2);

// Hedge a $10M beta-1.2 portfolio with index futures:
double contracts = MinimumVarianceHedge.fullHedgeContracts(1.2, 10_000_000, 5_000, 50);

## Tooling & Operations

- **CLI** (`cli.Main`) — run the library without writing Java:
  ```bash
  java -cp target/classes com.quantfinlib.cli.Main backtest \
      --csv bars.csv --symbol EURUSD --strategy sma --fast 10 --slow 30 --out report.html
  java -cp target/classes com.quantfinlib.cli.Main walkforward \
      --csv bars.csv --symbol EURUSD --train 252 --test 63 --fast 5,10,20 --slow 40,60
  java -cp target/classes com.quantfinlib.cli.Main report --csv bars.csv --symbol X --out x.html
  ```
- **Live dashboard** (`trading.TradingDashboard`) — zero-dep embedded HTTP server
  (JDK `httpserver`) showing the paper-trading account live in a browser: equity, cash,
  realized P&L, positions, rejections, and attached latency histograms
  (`/` self-refreshing page, `/api/status` JSON).
- **JMH microbenchmarks** (test scope only — the runtime stays zero-dependency):
  ```bash
  mvn test-compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.quantfinlib.bench.BenchRunner \
      -Dexec.classpathScope=test -Dexec.args=CoreBenchmarks
  ```
- **Docs site** — the Docs workflow builds and publishes a landing page + full javadoc
  site to GitHub Pages on every push to main:
  [ashjha0.github.io/Quant-Finance-Library](https://ashjha0.github.io/Quant-Finance-Library/)
  (javadoc under [`/api/`](https://ashjha0.github.io/Quant-Finance-Library/api/)).
- **Model-based fuzz tests** — the `OrderBook` is hammered with 100k random operations
  against an independent reference model (uncrossed book, depth conservation, cancel
  idempotence, queue-position consistency), and all three ring buffers run 2M-item
  concurrent SPSC stress with randomized batching.

## Alpha Research Pipeline

`com.quantfinlib.alpha` is the systematic factor-research workflow, end to end,
with each stage a separate composable step (scores flow as plain `double[]`
aligned to a frozen symbol panel; NaN = no data at every stage):

1. **Signal generation** (`Factors`) — nine standard factors: MA crossover, MACD,
   12-1 momentum (trend); contrarian RSI (Cutler's — named so, because it is NOT
   Wilder's `Indicators.rsi`), Bollinger reversion, mean reversion (reversal);
   value (earnings+book yield), quality (ROE − leverage), low volatility
   (defensive). Stateless, O(window), no-look-ahead by contract — and
   survivorship-aware: attach a `PointInTimeUniverse` via
   `AlphaContext.withUniverse` and every factor scores dead/non-member names
   NaN per bar, so ICs and weights only ever see the point-in-time
   cross-section.
2. **Signal evaluation** (`SignalEvaluator`) — rank IC (Spearman, monotone-invariant),
   Grinold-Kahn IR, t-stat on non-overlapping windows, hit rate, implied turnover,
   and cross-factor exposure (is your "new" factor just momentum in a hat).
3. **Validation** (`AlphaValidation`) — walk-forward selection with OOS efficiency,
   blocked k-fold consistency (no shuffled folds on time series), Monte Carlo
   permutation p-values (deliberately conservative for time-invariant signals),
   and parameter sensitivity (plateau vs lucky spike).
4. **Execution-aware backtest** (`AlphaBacktester`) — commission, bid-ask spread,
   slippage, and square-root market impact via `microstructure.MarketImpactModel`
   with per-symbol ADV/vol estimation: gross vs net curves and a per-component
   cost decomposition, so "which cost kills this signal" has a number.
5. **Portfolio construction** (`PortfolioConstruction`) — winsorized z-score sizing
   with caps, inverse-vol risk budgeting, exact sector and beta neutralization
   (Σwβ = 0 by projection), and an unconstrained mean-variance tilt (Σ⁻¹α).
6. **Reporting** (`AlphaReport`) — alpha decay profile with half-life, OLS factor
   attribution (residual alpha + R²), drawdown curves, rolling Sharpe, and the
   shared ratio set (Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar/CAGR/maxDD) from the backtest engine —
   definitions never fork between research and backtests.

```java
AlphaContext ctx = AlphaContext.of(alignedSeries, fundamentals);
AlphaFactor momo = Factors.momentum(252, 21);
SignalEvaluator.Report ic = SignalEvaluator.evaluate(ctx, momo, 260, 21);
AlphaValidation.RobustnessResult mc = AlphaValidation.monteCarloRobustness(ctx, momo, 21, 260, 500, 42);
AlphaBacktester.Result bt = AlphaBacktester.run(ctx, momo, AlphaBacktester.Config.defaults(260),
        (c, scores, t) -> PortfolioConstruction.betaNeutralize(
                PortfolioConstruction.zScoreWeights(scores, 1.0, 0.05),
                PortfolioConstruction.trailingBetas(c, t, 60)));
```

## FX & Equities Instruments

Beyond spot, the library speaks the market's own conventions per asset class:

- **FX conventions** (`fx.CurrencyPair`) — pip sizes/precision (JPY quotes), T+1/T+2
  spot lags, settlement dates against *both* currencies' holiday calendars, forward
  tenor arithmetic (ON/TN/SN, weeks, months with modified-following and the end-end
  rule). Resolved to primitives at setup so the hot path never re-parses conventions.
- **FX forwards & swaps** (`fx.SwapPointsCurve`, `fx.FxSwap`) — quoted points per tenor
  → outrights for any broken date (linear in days, the interbank convention),
  covered-interest-parity implied carry, at-market swaps that value to zero by
  construction, points MTM with optional discounting, tom-next roll cost.
- **NDFs** (`fx.Ndf`) — fixing vs settlement dates per restricted currency (INR/KRW/TWD
  2-day lags, BRL PTAX 1-day), the USD-settled difference formula (divides by the
  fixing), MTM off the forward to the *fixing* date; `fx.FixingRisk` quantifies
  fix-window tracking error (σ²T/3 law) and participation.
- **FX options** (`fx.FxVolSurface`, `pricing.VannaVolga`) — the delta-quoted smile the
  market actually trades: ATM DNS + 25Δ/10Δ risk-reversal/butterfly → solved strikes
  (closed-form forward delta, bisection for premium-adjusted), then vanna-volga
  smile-consistent pricing/vols at any strike (exact at the pillars).
- **First-generation exotics** (`pricing`) — cash/asset-or-nothing digitals, one-touch/
  no-touch (reflection-principle hit probabilities), regular single-barrier knock-in/out
  (Reiner-Rubinstein closed form with in-out parity; reverse barriers are rejected, not
  silently mispriced) — all Monte Carlo cross-checked in tests.
- **Equity dividends & borrow** (`pricing.DividendSchedule`) — escrowed discrete
  dividends (PV-stripped spot), forwards with borrow cost, dividend-consistent
  European pricing; the forward-looking counterpart of `data.CorporateActions`.
- **Exchange mechanics** (`microstructure`) — `TickSizeSchedule` (MiFID II-style
  price-banded ticks with directional rounding, wired into the tick backtester via
  `Config.withTickSchedule`) and `Auction` (call-auction uncross: max volume →
  min surplus → reference proximity, market-on-auction orders, indicative feed).
- **Last look** (`backtest.LastLookExecution`) — FX-realistic execution model: the LP
  rejects fills when the intra-bar move runs beyond a threshold in the taker's favor,
  so backtests chase the market the way live FX flow actually does; reject-rate TCA
  included.
- **Survivorship-bias defense** (`data.PointInTimeUniverse`) — point-in-time universe
  membership (intervals, drop-and-re-add) with terminal events: delistings terminate
  positions at `lastClose × (1 + delistingReturn)` (Shumway −30% haircut constant for
  unknown involuntary proceeds), mergers convert to cash and/or acquirer shares at deal
  terms, index drops force liquidation. Wired into `PortfolioBacktester` (universe-aware
  overload, plus explicit **cash dividends on the ex-date** — shorts pay) and the
  screener (`StockScreener.membersAsOf`). With
  `Config.withCostModel(TradeCostModel.institutional(...))` the same run also charges
  commission + spread + slippage + square-root market impact — survivorship-aware and
  execution-aware in one backtest. Membership/event data loads from a documented
  CSV format (`data.UniverseCsvLoader`: MEMBER/DELIST/MERGER rows, ISO or epoch dates —
  free constituent lists like `datasets/s-and-p-500-companies` seed it, though only
  point-in-time histories remove the bias), and
  `backtest.portfolio.CrossSectionalMomentum` (12-1 Jegadeesh-Titman long/short) shows
  the pattern: every rebalance ranks only the members alive at that bar. The engine half
  is here and tested — the data half (dead-ticker histories, delisting returns;
  CRSP-style datasets) cannot be solved by code, and the docs say so.

## Ultra-Low-Latency / HFT Path

The library ships two market data paths. The convenience path
(`MarketDataProcessor`, String symbols, event objects) is for research and monitoring.
The **HFT path** is a zero-allocation, zero-lock, zero-map-lookup tick pipeline for
latency-critical trading:

| Component | Design |
|---|---|
| `TickRingBuffer` | Disruptor-style SPSC ring: preallocated primitive slots (`int/double/long` arrays — no event objects), cache-line-padded sequences (no false sharing), acquire/release publication (no CAS), producer/consumer sequence caching (minimal cross-core traffic) |
| `SymbolRegistry` | Symbols interned to dense int ids once at setup — the hot path never hashes a String |
| `HftMarketDataBus` | Array-indexed listener dispatch and last-price cache (no map lookups), optional busy-spin consumer (`Thread.onSpinWait()`) for minimum hand-off latency |
| `StreamingIndicators` | O(1)-per-tick SMA / EMA / RSI / MACD / VWAP, verified value-for-value identical to the batch engine — backtest results transfer to live execution exactly |
| `LatencyRecorder` | Zero-allocation log-linear nanosecond histogram (HdrHistogram-style) for measuring your own path |
| `HftRiskGate` (`trading`) | Zero-allocation pre-trade risk gate over dense int symbol ids: order size, notional, position, price collar, halt — int reason codes, ~3 ns/check with correct cross-thread visibility (VarHandle acquire/release: fills, halts and reference prices land from other threads and readers are guaranteed fresh, untorn values) |
| `HftOrderGateway` + `OrderRingBuffer` (`trading`) | The fast lane out: risk check → release-store publish into a preallocated primitive order ring → venue thread; zero allocation per order (proven by a per-thread allocation-counter test) |
| `sbe` package | SBE-style binary flyweight codecs (`TradeFlyweight`, `OrderFlyweight`, `QuoteFlyweight`: fixed-offset primitives, zero parse/copy/alloc — proven by test) with channel adapters replacing the text edges: `BinaryMarketDataClient` → bus, gateway → `BinaryOrderPublisher`; fragmentation-safe decode loops |
| `HftQuoter` (`trading`) | Streaming market maker on the fast lane: mid + inventory skew (read live from the risk gate) + tick-grid snap → two-sided quote through the gate and order ring, with conflation (min-move / min-interval) — zero allocation per tick |
| `AutoHedger` (`trading`) | Live position-band hedger: band breach on any tick fires a flattening order for the excess through the fast lane, with per-symbol cooldown while the hedge fill is in flight |
| `AggregatedBook` + `CrossRateEngine` (`fx`) | Multi-venue composite BBO with venue attribution (primitive arrays, zero alloc per quote, crossed composites reported not hidden) and streaming synthetic crosses (EURJPY from EURUSD×USDJPY) chained on the bus consumer thread |
| `IncrementalGreeks` (`pricing`) | Tick-fresh options risk without tick-frequency repricing: delta-gamma Taylor updates per tick (two multiplies, zero alloc), full Black-Scholes re-anchor off the hot path on drift |
| `HftOrderBook` (`orderbook`) | Venue-grade matching engine: dense integer-tick price ladder with occupancy bitmaps, pooled intrusive order nodes, primitive open-addressing id map (backward-shift deletion), zero allocation — ~204ns/op, 10M+ fills/sec; a model-based equivalence test pins it to the readable reference `OrderBook`. Full equities time-in-force set: limit, market, IOC, FOK (bitmap liquidity probe), post-only (`REJECT_WOULD_CROSS`) |
| `ItchCodec` + `L3BookBuilder` (`marketdata`) | The equities participant stack: ITCH 5.0-style flyweight codec (packed-long symbols, 0.0001-tick int prices) driving full-depth L3 book reconstruction — same ladder/bitmap/pool disciplines as the matching engine, plus exact own-order queue position (`sharesAhead`): one FIFO walk to initialize, O(1) per event after, zero allocation |
| `Nbbo` (`marketdata`) | Multi-venue NBBO consolidation: inside price/size, venue bitmasks at the touch, locked/crossed detection; listener fires only on inside changes (natural conflation), zero alloc per venue update |
| `SignalEngine` + `FlowSignals` (`microstructure`) | The unified streaming signal engine, one instance for all symbols, equities and FX alike: imbalance (Cont-Kukanov OFI, queue, trade flow), microprice, time-aware volatility and momentum (decay by elapsed time — constant-step EMAs mis-weight irregular ticks), liquidity (spread/depth/quote intensity) and a weighted dimensionless composite — allocation-free per event, gap-disciplined (one-sided quotes poison nothing) |
| Quant models (`microstructure`) | The models that feed the benchmark executor's `MarketState`: `VolumeCurve` (dynamic intraday volume prediction — learned profile + live realized-vs-expected rescale, the live VWAP curve), `VolatilityCurve` (intraday vol seasonality — `regime()` is the normalized vol input, so the always-wild open doesn't read as urgency but a wild lunchtime does), `SpreadForecaster` (time-of-day baseline + mean-reverting deviation — damps before a known-wide window, not after), `QueuePositionEstimator` (L2 queue position via pro-rata cancel attribution — the L3-exact sibling is `L3BookBuilder.sharesAhead`), `HiddenLiquidityDetector` (iceberg inference: one print larger than the display is hidden size), `TradeClassifier` (Lee-Ready aggressor inference for feeds that don't say who initiated), `FillProbabilityModel` (passive fill = touch probability × queue-clear probability). All streaming, allocation-free, cross-asset |
| Adaptive models (`microstructure`) | The layer that learns on top of the models: `OnlineAlphaLearner` (online ridge-SGD from the signal-engine ingredients to next-interval returns — predictions are scored **before** each outcome updates the weights, so the rolling out-of-sample IC is genuinely prequential and a learner that found noise emits no signal), `LeadLagEstimator` (streaming cross-asset lead-lag: EURUSD leads EURJPY, futures lead cash — per-lag decayed correlations, best-lag detection, regression prediction of the follower's next move), `DayTypeProfiles` (expiry days, half days and FX fixing days have different volume/vol/spread shapes — one independently learned curve per day type), `EwmaCovariance` (streaming RiskMetrics-style covariance matrix: marginal basket risk for the portfolio executor, live min-variance hedge ratios — full-vector updates so the matrix stays PSD), `AvellanedaStoikov` (`trading`: closed-form optimal quotes — inventory-shaded reservation price + the γσ²τ/liquidity-floor spread, the principled version of `HftQuoter`'s skew), `KylesLambda` (impact learned from the tape — streaming Δp-on-signed-flow regression, the live `MarketState.impactBps` producer; a noisy negative estimate is clamped, never a subsidy), `JumpRobustVolatility` (bipower variation: one headline print reads as a jump, not a volatility regime — feed its robust vol to `VolatilityCurve`), `ClosingAuctionModel` (learned auction share + imbalance-tilted reserve for the close — a documented-contract structure: the imbalance-feed mapping and sensitivity need validation against your venue's dissemination). The whole learning loop — models → executor → router → scorecards → checkpoint → restore — is exercised end-to-end over five synthetic days by `OvernightLearningLoopTest` |
| `HftSor` (`execution`) | Zero-allocation smart order router: greedy all-in-price sweep (fees/rebates in ticks) over parallel venue arrays, splits at displayed size into a caller-owned array — the tick-path sibling of the readable `SmartOrderRouter` |
| `BenchmarkExecutor` (`execution`) | The dynamic benchmark algorithm: one stateful executor for **VWAP, TWAP, Arrival Price, Implementation Shortfall, Closing Price, Opening Price, and Participation (POV)** that re-decides every interval from live market state — bid/ask spread, order-book depth, volatility, the volume curve, alpha signal and a liquidity cap — instead of emitting a fixed slice list. Each benchmark is a completion curve (TWAP linear, Arrival/IS front-loaded, Close back-loaded, Open aggressively front-loaded, VWAP on the volume profile, POV on realized volume); the dynamic layer accelerates on adverse alpha, damps on wide spreads, trades the vol/timing-risk trade-off per benchmark, and caps each child at the displayed depth. Cross-asset (doubles) |
| `PortfolioExecutor` (`execution`) | True multi-symbol portfolio-level scheduling: a basket (transition, rebalance, program) executed as one coordinated schedule over per-symbol `BenchmarkExecutor` children. Two overlays that only exist at basket level: a **leg-balance band** (the buy and sell legs of a transition stay in step, so the basket never carries unintended net exposure mid-flight — the ahead leg throttles; the lagging leg is never pushed past its own benchmark) and a **per-interval notional budget** allocated risk-weighted — by default weight ∝ (1 + vol regime) × due notional (the diagonal approximation of multi-asset Almgren-Chriss, stated as such); plug in a streaming `EwmaCovariance` via `useRiskModel` and the budget flows by marginal contribution to *basket* variance, so two correlated legs read as one concentrated risk and a natural hedge earns no urgency. Overlays only ever damp; deferred quantity reappears through each child's own catch-up. Zero-alloc decide |
| `Checkpoint` (`persist`) | Multi-day persistence of learned state — what a desk does **not** want to relearn every morning: volume/vol/spread baselines, alpha weights *plus their out-of-sample IC evidence* (restored trust is earned trust), lead-lag correlations, venue and LP scorecards. One binary file of named sections, committed atomically (temp + rename — a crash mid-save never corrupts yesterday's file); intraday state deliberately resets on restore; configuration mismatches and format drift throw instead of misaligning arrays. `HiddenLiquidityDetector` is deliberately not persistable: its state is price-level-keyed and stale overnight |
| `AdaptiveSor` + `VenueScorecard` (`execution`) | The full-checklist router: expected-cost routing that prices in displayed AND hidden liquidity, fees/rebates, latency (× urgency), fill probability, a reliability veto and **adverse selection** (post-fill markout: a venue whose fills systematically revert charges that reversion per share — two identical quotes are not equal when one venue's fills fade) — all learned per venue from a streaming scorecard (fill rate, measured latency, realized dark-probe fills, fill markouts) — with contingent dark-pool probes sized by learned liquidity and a queue-position helper via `QueueModel`. Given A: 10k@120µs, B: 8k@80µs (same price), dark unknown, it routes 8k→B, 2k→A, and probes the dark pool — the textbook plan |
| `OrderThrottle` (`trading`) + `CircuitBreakers` (`microstructure`) | Venue self-protection: nanosecond token-bucket message-rate throttle (deterministic, caller-clocked); LULD price bands with the 15s-limit-state→5-min-pause machine and market-wide 7/13/20% halt levels (styled after the SEC plan, not certified) |
| `PovTracker` + `ImplementationShortfallScheduler` (`execution`) | The two execution algos TWAP/VWAP can't cover: streaming percentage-of-volume participation ledger (measures against others' flow, so the algo never chases itself), and Almgren-Chriss-optimal IS slicing with a trader-friendly front-load→risk-aversion calibrator |
| `FxTierBook` + `LpScorecard` + `LpRouter` (`fx`) | The FX participant stack — quotes, not orders: per-LP size-tier ladders with sweep-cost and full-amount queries, streaming last-look analytics (EWMA reject rate, hold time, post-reject markout), and expected-all-in routing that prices rejects into the decision — all zero allocation |
| `FixMarketDataView` (`fix`) + `LastLookGate` (`trading`) | Garbage-free FIX 35=W/X market-data decoding (entry position = tier, scaled-long prices) completing the FIX hot path: feed in, orders out, fills in — plus the maker-side symmetric last-look gate per the FX Global Code, with a randomized test asserting its rejects split 50/50 by direction |
| `HiccupMonitor` (`util`) | jHiccup-style platform stall attribution: every benchmark prints a hiccup summary so tail outliers are correctly attributed to GC/safepoints/scheduler vs code (on the Windows dev box: benchmark max 541µs vs platform hiccups up to 1.6ms — the platform owns the tail) |

```java
try (HftMarketDataBus bus = new HftMarketDataBus(1 << 16, 16, /*busySpin*/ true)) {
    int eurusd = bus.registerSymbol("EURUSD");           // setup: intern once
    var fast = new StreamingIndicators.Ema(12);
    var slow = new StreamingIndicators.Ema(26);
    bus.subscribe(eurusd, (id, price, size, tsNanos) -> { // hot path: primitives only
        if (fast.update(price) > slow.update(price)) { /* fire order */ }
    });
    bus.start();
    bus.publish(eurusd, 1.0850, 1_000_000, System.nanoTime()); // zero allocation
}
```

**Measured** (`HftLatencyBenchmark`, JDK 24, Windows 11, stock desktop hardware —
strategy workload of 2×EMA + RSI per tick plus latency recording included in every number):

```
Market data (HftLatencyBenchmark):
  Throughput:                  9-12 million ticks/sec sustained (0 ticks lost)
  Publish-to-strategy latency: p50=204ns  p99=300-800ns  p99.9=~2.4us

Order entry (HftOrderBenchmark):
  Risk gate:                   ~3 ns per pre-trade check (cross-thread safe)
  Submit-to-venue latency:     p50=102ns  p99=296ns  p99.9=1.4us
  Tick-to-order END-TO-END:    p50=504ns  p99=1.0us  p99.9=4.0us
                               (tick -> bus -> 2xEMA strategy -> risk gate -> order ring -> venue)
  Throughput:                  21.2 million orders/sec sustained (v1.4.1 run; 15-21M across runs)

Market making (HftQuoterBenchmark):
  Tick-to-two-sided-quote:     p50=592ns  p99=912ns  p99.9=4.5us
                               (tick -> bus -> quoter: skew + grid snap -> risk gate x2 -> order ring -> venue, BOTH sides)

Matching engine (HftBookBenchmark, venue side):
  Per-operation latency:       p50=204ns  p99=504ns (70/20/10 add/cancel/aggress mix)
  Matching:                    10M+ fills/sec;  Passive churn: 7M+ add/cancel ops/sec
                               (also completes under Epsilon GC: 5.6M orders, GC never ran)
```

Reproduce with:

```bash
java -Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -cp target/classes com.quantfinlib.examples.HftLatencyBenchmark
java -Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -cp target/classes com.quantfinlib.examples.HftOrderBenchmark
java -Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -cp target/classes com.quantfinlib.examples.HftQuoterBenchmark
java -Xms1g -Xmx1g -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -cp target/classes com.quantfinlib.examples.HftBookBenchmark
```

Steady-state the hot path allocates nothing, so GC choice barely matters; for
production-grade tail latency also consider `-XX:+UseZGC`, core pinning via OS affinity
for the producer and consumer threads, and disabling CPU frequency scaling.

**Going further**: [docs/ULTRA_LOW_LATENCY.md](docs/ULTRA_LOW_LATENCY.md) is the full
latency-stack reference — what's implemented here, the JVM flags, the kernel/CPU tuning
([scripts/linux-tune.sh](scripts/linux-tune.sh), plus a manual `Benchmarks (Linux)`
workflow), and the kernel-bypass/off-heap/hardware frontier beyond a pure-JDK library.
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) maps every package (each also carries
`package-info.java` javadoc) to its classes and tests, and
[docs/DIAGRAMS.md](docs/DIAGRAMS.md) renders the architecture visually — the two-lane
design, the measured hot path end to end, the alpha pipeline, per-bar survivorship event
ordering, the matching engine's internals, the FX instrument map, the execution decision
map (models → benchmark executor → routers), portfolio-level basket scheduling, and the
overnight checkpoint lifecycle (Mermaid, renders directly on GitHub).
